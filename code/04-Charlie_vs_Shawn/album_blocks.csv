carry on  but she knew that she would be okay so she didnt let it get in her way  sometimes it all gets a little too much but you gotta realize that soon the fog will clear up and you dont have to be afraid because were all the same and we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much  she would always tell herself she could do this she would use no help it would be just fine but when it got hard she would lose her focus so take my hand and well be alright  and she knew that she would be okay so she didnt let it get in her way  sometimes it all gets a little too much but you gotta realize that soon the fog will clear up and you dont have to be afraid because were all the same and we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much yeah  a little too much i said a little too much oh
