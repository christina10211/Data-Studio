A server establishes a user/client pair as trusted by issuing a trust token to the client when successfully authenticating to the server for the first time. Subsequently, the client provides the trust token at login. At the server, rate policies apportion bandwidth according to type of traffic: network requests that include a valid trust token are granted highest priority. Rate policies further specify bandwidth restrictions imposed for untrusted network traffic.",,"FACEBOOK, INC.","February 12, 2010","July 10, 2018",Christopher Newell Toomey,20100146612,"Method and apparatus for trust-based, fine-grained rate limiting of network requests",Grant,https://patents.justia.com/patent/10021081

The face tracking system identifies a mesh shape adjusted to an image of a face. For each decision tree, the face tracking system identifies an adjustment vector for the mesh shape relative to the image of the face. For each cascade level, the face tracking system combines the identified adjustment for each decision tree to determine a combined adjustment vector for the cascade level.

A fast path is typically a path that handles most commonly occurring tasks more efficiently than less commonly occurring ones which are handled by slow paths. The less commonly occurring tasks may include uncommon cases, error handling, and other anomalies. The IR includes checkpoints which evaluate to two possible values resulting in either a fast path or slow path execution. The IR is optimized for fast path execution by regenerating a checkpoint as a labeled checkpoint.

During compilation phase, the program objects in the source code are identified, and each of the program objects is assigned a slot in a target cache. The slot is configured to store a pointer that points to a particular implementation of a program object to which the slot is assigned. During execution phase, the particular implementation of the program object is determined based on execution flow of the source code. After the particular implementation is determined, the program object is bound to the particular implementation by updating the assigned target cache slot with a pointer pointing to the particular implementation.",,"FACEBOOK, INC.","November 30, 2012","March 17, 2015","Keith Adams, Andrew John Paroski, Jason Owen Evans",20140157291,Method and system for binding objects in dynamic programming languages using caching techniques,Grant,https://patents.justia.com/patent/8984542

Because the pressure differential is the same for all of the servers, it is desirable to operate the data center such that each server needs the same pressure differential for proper cooling. Accordingly, a load balancer assigns tasks to the servers based on the known cooling needs of each server in order to balance the pressure differential needed to cool the server. This information may also be sent to the central fan to ensure that a sufficient pressure is created by the fan.

For subsequent requests, the dynamic page is created from the cached version, which is shareable across users and across requests.

The basic accountholder eventually requires the additional services provided by the more flexible wallet, typically editing rights and making purchases at sites requiring authentication beyond the basic level. To convert the account, the account holder is presented with a one-time challenge and response mechanism that requires the accountholder to summon information that only the account holder would know. If a successful match is made, the account is converted to the more flexible account for all time. The accountholder replaces the one-time challenge and response with a second-level password that grants the accountholder ongoing access to more sensitive wallet features, such as the ability to purchase at sites requiring a second-level password, and editing rights to the information stored in the wallet.","FACEBOOK, INC.",,"September 15, 2012",,"Benjamin Quigley, Robert Sandler, Fletcher Jones, Rajesh Mahajan, Prakash Muppirala, David Lowe, Laura Price, Seth Goldstein, Venkatesh Subramanya, Jai Rawat",20130124408,System and Method for Electronic Wallet Conversion,Application,https://patents.justia.com/patent/20130124408

An inferential ad enables advertisers to reach members that do not meet targeting criteria for lack of information. A member's connections in the social network that satisfy the targeting criteria are leveraged to infer a targeted interest.

An external system that interacts with users (such as a website) communicates with the social network to access information about the members of the social network.

3053,"Applications in social networks support interaction between members through various types of channels such as notifications, newsfeed, and so forth. For each channel, applications are ranked based on their user affinity measures. User affinity is based on measuring positive and negative interactions by users as both senders and recipients of messages generated by applications. Metrics are computed for the different types of messages and interactions provided by applications. For each channel, an application receives user affinity score based on specific weighted combination of the metrics. Applications use channel resources to send messages to increase their user base. Given the large number of applications that are available, the extent to which applications are allowed to use channels is controlled, limiting their resource consumption. User affinity scores of applications calculated for a channel are used to decide the allocation of channel resources for an application.","FACEBOOK, INC.",,"October 16, 2008",,"Thomas Scott Whitnah, Matthew Alexander Rush, Ding Zhou, Ruchi Sanghvi",20100049852,RESOURCE MANAGEMENT OF SOCIAL NETWORK APPLICATIONS,Application,https://patents.justia.com/patent/20100049852
