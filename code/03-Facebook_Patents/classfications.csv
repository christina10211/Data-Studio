The interaction engine also measures the reach of pages and posts, by determining how and from where each user viewed the page and its contents. The interaction engine further tracks the community's interest in pages and posts by determining how many unique users create stories that include a page or its content. An insights module uses the data obtained by the interaction engine to synthesize graphical reports about page interactions and present the reports to page administrators.",ELECTRICITY,ELECTRIC COMMUNICATION TECHNIQUE,"TRANSMISSION OF DIGITAL INFORMATION, e.g. TELEGRAPHIC COMMUNICATION"

Load balancing tasks in a data center based on pressure differential needed for cooling servers,2010-01-01,Grant,"In a data center that cools servers using an airflow from a central fan, rather than individual server fans, the cooling needs for each server are met by creating a sufficient pressure differential across each server. Because the pressure differential is the same for all of the servers, it is desirable to operate the data center such that each server needs the same pressure differential for proper cooling. Accordingly, a load balancer assigns tasks to the servers based on the known cooling needs of each server in order to balance the pressure differential needed to cool the server. This information may also be sent to the central fan to ensure that a sufficient pressure is created by the fan. Determining the cooling needs beforehand avoids spikes in server temperature, thereby enabling the servers to operate safely at a temperature closer to their maximum rated temperatures.",ELECTRICITY,ELECTRIC TECHNIQUES NOT OTHERWISE PROVIDED FOR,PRINTED CIRCUITS; CASINGS OR CONSTRUCTIONAL DETAILS OF ELECTRIC APPARATUS; MANUFACTURE OF ASSEMBLAGES OF ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS
