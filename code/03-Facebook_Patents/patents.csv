"A face tracking system generates a model for extracting a set of facial anchor points on a face within a portion of a face image based a multiple-level cascade of decision trees. The face tracking system identifies a mesh shape adjusted to an image of a face. For each decision tree, the face tracking system identifies an adjustment vector for the mesh shape relative to the image of the face. For each cascade level, the face tracking system combines the identified adjustment for each decision tree to determine a combined adjustment vector for the cascade level. The face tracking system modifies adjustment of the mesh shape to the face in the image based on the combined adjustment vector. The face tracking system reduces the model to a dictionary and atom weights using a learned dictionary. The model may be more easily transmitted to devices and stored on devices.","FACEBOOK, INC.","December 25, 2016","July 10, 2018",Evgeny Zatepyakin,10019651,Robust shape prediction for face alignment,Grant,https://patents.justia.com/patent/10019651

The multi-level privacy evaluation technology evaluates data using a subset of privacy policy rules and privacy information determined for the data at a backend server and thereby reduces the volume of data that need to be filtered at a frontend server. The multi-level privacy evaluation technology first applies an initial privacy check on a large data set at the backend to authoritatively filter out any data that a viewing user is not permitted to view or access and return as results a smaller data set that the viewing user may be permitted to view or access. A full privacy check is then performed at the frontend on the smaller data set, resulting in reduction in the overall cost of performing privacy checks and reducing latency in displaying data to the viewing user.","FACEBOOK, INC.","May 9, 2014","October 4, 2016","Bhupinder Singh Sethi, Shiyu Zhao, Yang Xia",9460308,Multi-level privacy evaluation,Grant,https://patents.justia.com/patent/9460308

The messaging system accesses a social networking system database to obtain social information about a relationship between the recipient and the identified object. The message is then indexed using the social information, wherein an entry for the message is stored in a message index based on the social information. This process may be repeated for each received message, and multiple different message indexes may be generated for received messages to track different types of social information. A user interface for viewing messages uses the message index to organize the messages, such as to filter, categorize, and/or sort the messages in the display.","FACEBOOK, INC.","December 30, 2014","May 31, 2016","Prashant Malik, Jiakai Liu, Andrew G.

The frequency of execution can be measured at runtime using a performance measurement tool without requiring modification of the binary code or corresponding source code. After density is computed (e.g., over a period of time) for functions, it can be used to cause linkers to rearrange the binary code to place denser functions closer to the “front” of the binary code.

"Disclosed here are methods, systems, paradigms and structures for optimizing intermediate representation (IR) of a script code for fast path execution. A fast path is typically a path that handles most commonly occurring tasks more efficiently than less commonly occurring ones which are handled by slow paths. The less commonly occurring tasks may include uncommon cases, error handling, and other anomalies. The IR includes checkpoints which evaluate to two possible values resulting in either a fast path or slow path execution. The IR is optimized for fast path execution by regenerating a checkpoint as a labeled checkpoint. The code in the portion of the IR following the checkpoint is optimized assuming the checkpoint evaluates to a value resulting in fast path. The code for handling situations where the checkpoint evaluates to a value resulting in slow path is transferred to a portion of the IR identified by the label.","FACEBOOK, INC.","May 2, 2013","March 29, 2016","Ali-Reza Adl-Tabatabai, Guilherme de Lima Ottoni, Michael Paleczny",9298433,Optimizing intermediate representation of script code for fast path execution,Grant,https://patents.justia.com/patent/9298433

This enhances overall system performance by eliminating the saving of state and processing inherent in interrupt handling, and also avoids missing events that may occur while other interrupts are masked during event handling. Specifically, the second process initializes a monitored memory area that is directly accessible by processes having at least the privilege level of the first process.

"A system and method for electronic wallet conversion allows conversion of a basic electronic wallet to a more flexible wallet account, providing additional services and requiring additional authentication. The basic accountholder eventually requires the additional services provided by the more flexible wallet, typically editing rights and making purchases at sites requiring authentication beyond the basic level. To convert the account, the account holder is presented with a one-time challenge and response mechanism that requires the accountholder to summon information that only the account holder would know. If a successful match is made, the account is converted to the more flexible account for all time. The accountholder replaces the one-time challenge and response with a second-level password that grants the accountholder ongoing access to more sensitive wallet features, such as the ability to purchase at sites requiring a second-level password, and editing rights to the information stored in the wallet.","FACEBOOK, INC.","October 20, 2003","June 25, 2013","Benjamin Quigley, Robert Sandler, Fletcher Jones, Rajesh Mahajan, Prakash Muppirala, David Lowe, Laura Price, Seth Goldstein, Venkatesh Subramanya, Jai Rawat",8473355,System and method for electronic wallet conversion,Grant,https://patents.justia.com/patent/8473355

"In a data center that cools servers using an airflow from a central fan, rather than individual server fans, the cooling needs for each server are met by creating a sufficient pressure differential across each server. Because the pressure differential is the same for all of the servers, it is desirable to operate the data center such that each server needs the same pressure differential for proper cooling. Accordingly, a load balancer assigns tasks to the servers based on the known cooling needs of each server in order to balance the pressure differential needed to cool the server. This information may also be sent to the central fan to ensure that a sufficient pressure is created by the fan. Determining the cooling needs beforehand avoids spikes in server temperature, thereby enabling the servers to operate safely at a temperature closer to their maximum rated temperatures.","FACEBOOK, INC.","August 10, 2010","June 18, 2013","Amir Meir Michael, Michael Paleczny",8467906,Load balancing tasks in a data center based on pressure differential needed for cooling servers,Grant,https://patents.justia.com/patent/8467906
